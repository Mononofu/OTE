OTE - Objectoriented Taskbased Engine
A small engine, demonstrating how multithreading can be achieved in a gaming environment by separating 
threads by tasks. Aimed to be independent of what libraries are used, currently only code for OGRE, Newton
and MyGUI is available, although it shouldn't be difficult to include something else
